# Taskinator
## Description
This is a task management web application using a "kanban board" layout. Add tasks using the form. You can edit and delete tasks using the buttons on the created task. You can use the dropdown menu on the created task to move it between the "To Do", "In Progress", and "Complete" sections of the board. The browser will save and reload your tasks between sessions using the localStorage API.
